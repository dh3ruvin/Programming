Q. HTTP and SSL protocols.
Ans:The hypertext transfer protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative and hypermedia information systems.
    HTTP is the protocol to transfer or exchange hypertext. The hypertext is the structured text that uses hyperlinks. HTTP 
    functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. the client submits an HTTP request to the server,
    to which the server provides resources such as HTML. HTTP is an application layes protocol designed with a framework of the
    Internet protocol suite. 

    SSL-Secure Sockets Layers are cryptographic perotocols that provide communication security over a computer network. 
        applications - Web browsing, email, instant messaging. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and 
        browsers remain private and integral. After activating your web server we get two cryptographic keys - a private key and
        a public key. The Public Key does not need to be secret and is placed into a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) - a data
        file also containing your details. You should then submit the CSR. During the SSL Certificate application process, the 
        Certification Authority will validate your details and issue an SSL Certificate containing your details and allowing you 
        to use SSL. Your web server will match your issued SSL Certificate to your Private Key. Your web server will then be able 
        to establish an encrypted link between the website and your customer's web browser.

Q. Explain what happens in details and behind the scene when you type in your browser google.com.
Ans: 

Q. Command line to check routing table in linux
Ans.The routing table is used to show you where various different network subnets will be routed to
    Using ip command - `ip route` or `ip r`.

Q. linux command to check disc space.
Ans:df - shows the amount of disc space used and available on linux file systems.
    du -Display the amount of disk space used by the specified files and for each subdirectory.

Q. linux command to list running processes.
Ans: ps -A or top

Q. Example of linux file system.
Ans:

Q. difference between /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages.
Ans. Syslog is a standard logging facility. It collects messages of various programs and services including the kernel, stores them 
     mdepending on the setup, in a buncl of log files. Logs everything 

    /var/log/messages instead aims at storing valuable, non-debug and non-critical messages. This log should be considered 
    the "general system activity" log.

Q. What is hhtp header ?
Ans. Http header allows the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. They define 
    operating paramters of an HTTP   transaction. The header fields are transmitted after the request or response line. A header
    consists of its case -sensitive name followed by a colon: then by its value. The standard imposes no limits to the size of 
    each header field name or value, or to the number field. However, most servers put size size restrictions for security reasons.

    Standard request field = Authorization, content-type, X-Csrf-Token, cookie
    Standard response field =  Access-Control-Allow-Origin, locartion, content-type

Q. What is ping ?
Ans:ping is a basic internet program that allows a user to verify that a particular IP address exists and can except request.
    ping works by sending an internet control message protocol (ICMP) exho request to a specified interface or network and 
    waiting for a reply. It is used measure latency, or the time it takes to send and receive a packet of data between two devices
    on a network. 

Q. what is the difference between ping and traceroute ?
Ans: Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route and measuring transit delays of packets across a
     network. It also shows the number of hops required to reaxcxh to that point.

     The main difference between Ping and Traceroute is that Ping is a quick and easy utility to tell if the specified server 
     is reachable and how long will it take to send and receive data from the server whereas Traceroute finds the exact route 
     taken to reach the server and time taken by each step (hop).

Q. Define tcp connection ?
Ans: TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation via which application programs can 
    exchange data. TCP wotks with the IP, which defines how computes sends packets of data to each other,TCP is a
    connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at 
    each end have finished exchanging messages.

Q. 4 ways close?
Ans. 

Q. 6 flags in tcp header ?
Ans: SYN: Synchronization flag is used to setup a 3-way handshake between two hosts.
     ACK: Acknowledgement.
     FIN: Finished, there is no more data from the sender.
     URG: notify received to process urgent packets before regular packets.
     PSH: tells the receiver to process these packets as they are received instead of buffering,
     RST: reset.
     CWR: The CWR flag, which stands for Congestion Window Reduced, is used by the sending host 
          to indicate it received a packet with the ECE flag set.

Q. Define submask ?
Ans: A subnet mask is a 32 bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address.

Q. Location of messages in linux ?

Q. Define NTP ?
Ans - Network time protocol is used to syncrhonize computer clock times in a network.

Q. Define INode ?
Ans: An inode is a data-structure on a file system on linux that stores al the information about a file excepts its name and 
    its actual data.

Q. Which one is better? HashTable or Binary balanced trees? List scenarios when you will prefer HashTable.
Ans: Hasn table supports following operations 1. Search, insert, delete - O(1), in BST its O(Logn)..
    Advantages of BST
    Can get all keys in sorted order just by doing inorder traversal.
    Doing order statistics, finding closest lower and greater elements doing range queries are easy to do with BSTs.
    time is always O(Logn), can change in Hash table, expecially in resizing.

Q. Difference between Router, Hub and a switch ?
Ans: Router: It forwards data packets along networks. Routers are located at the gateways. Connected to atleast two networks
    Switch: swithc is a device that filters and forwards packets between LAN segments. operated in data link later or network layer.
    Hub: A hub is a common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs connect segments of a LAN. It contains multiple ports so 
    when a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets.

Q. Explain OSI model ?
Q. Explain TCP 3-way handshake ?
Ans: 
    A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between a local host/client and server. 
    It is a three-step method that requires both the client and server to exchange SYN and ACK (acknowledgment) packets 
    before actual data communication begins.
    
Q. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses ?
Ans:  IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It is the underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect 
    our devices to the web. Whenever a device access the Internet (whether it's a PC, Mac, smartphone or other device), 
    it is assigned a unique, numerical IP address such as 99.48.227.227. To send data from one computer to another through 
    the web, a data packet must be transferred across the network containing the IP addresses of both devices.

Q linux Command - ls, grep, find ?
Ans:searches for matching a regular expression against text in a file, multiple files or a stream of input. It searches 
    for the pattern of text that you specify on the command line and prints output for you.

Q. Size of a TCP window?

Advantage of object oriented programming
    * Modular development of code, which leads easy maintenace and modification.
    * Reusability of code
    * Improved reliability and flexibility of code.
    * Increased understanding of code.

Characteristic features of Object oriented programming.
    * Encapsulation - Encapsulation provides object with the ability to hide their internal characteristics and behaviour. Each 
      object provides a number of methods, which can be accessed by other objects and change its internal data. Advantages of
      using encapsulation are listed below.
        - The internal state of every object is protected by hiding its attributes.
        - It increases usability and maintaince of code, because the behaviour of an object can be independently changed or
          extended.
        - It improves modularity by preventing objects to interact with each other, in an undesired way.

    * Polymorphism - It is the ability of the data to be represented in more than one form. A polymorphic type is a type whose
        operations can also be applied to values of some other types.

    * Inheritance - Inheritance provides an object with the ability to acquire the fields and methods of another class, called
        base class. Inheritance provides re-usability of code and can be used to add additional features to an existing class.
    
    * Abstractions - Abstraction is the process of showing only necessary details to the putside world.

Differene between Abstractions and Encapsulation
    Abstraction and encapsulation are complementary concepts. On one hand, abstraction focuses on the behaviour of an object. On
    the other hand, encapsulation focuses on the implementation of an object's behaviour. Encapsulation is usually acheived by 
    hiding information about the internal state of an object thus, can be seen as a strategy in order to provide abstraction.


Q. What is JVM>  Why is Java called the “Platform Independent Programming Language” ?
Ans. A JVM is a virtual machine which is capable of executing the java bytecode. Java was desgined to allow applications programs
    to be built that could be run on any platform, without having to be rewritten or recompiled by the programmer for each seperate
    platforms.

Q. Difference between JDK and JRE?
Ans. JRE is basically JVM where the java programs are being executed. 
     IDK is a fully featured SDK for java, including the JRE.

Q. What does the “static” keyword mean ? Can you override private or static method in Java ?
Ans. The static keyword denotes that a member variable or method can be accessed, without requiring an instantiation of the 
     class to which it belongs. A user cannot override static methods in java, because method overriding in based on dynamic 
     binding at runtime and static methods are statically binded at compile time.
    
Q. Can you access non static variable in static context ?
Ans. No, because those variables are not created yet and they are not associated with any instance.

Q. What is Function Overriding and Overloading in Java ?
Ans. Method overloading in Java occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the exact same name, but different 
     parameters. On the other hand, method overriding is defined as the case when a child class redefines the same method 
     as a parent class. Overridden methods must have the same name, argument list, and return type. The overriding method 
     may not limit the access of the method it overrides.

Q. What is a Constructor, Constructor Overloading in Java and Copy-Constructor ?
Ans. A constructor is invoked whenever the new instance of the class is created. Java does support copy constructors like 
     C++, but the difference lies in the fact that Java doesn’t create a default copy constructor if you don’t write your own.

Q.  Does Java support multiple inheritance ?
Ans. No, Java does not support multiple inheritance. Each class is able to extend only on one class, but is able to implement
     more than one interfaces.

Q. What is the difference between an Interface and an Abstract class ?
Ans. All methods in an interface are implicitly abstract. On the other hand, an abstract class may contain both abstract 
     and non-abstract methods.
     A class may implement a number of Interfaces, but can extend only one abstract class.
     In order for a class to implement an interface, it must implement all its declared methods. However, a class may not 
     implement all declared methods of an abstract class. Though, in this case, the sub-class must also be declared as abstract.
     Abstract classes can implement interfaces without even providing the implementation of interface methods.
     Variables declared in a Java interface is by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
     Members of a Java interface are public by default. A member of an abstract class can either be private, protected or public.

Q. What are pass by reference and pass by value ?
Ans. When an object is passed by value, this means that a copy of the object is passed. Thus, even if changes are made to that object, 
     it doesn’t affect the original value. When an object is passed by reference, this means that the actual object is not passed, 
     rather a reference of the object is passed. Thus, any changes made by the external method, are also reflected in all places.

Q. What is the difference between a process and a threads ?
Ans. A process is an execution of a program, while a Thread is a single execution sequence within a process. 
     A process can contain multiple threads. A Thread is sometimes called a lightweight process.

Q. Explain different ways of creating a thread.Which one would you prefer and why ?
Ans. Three ways:-
      A class may extend the thread class.
      A class may implement the runnable interface.
      An application can use the Executor framework, in order to create a thread pool.
      The Runnable interface is preferred, as it does not require an object to inherit the Thread class.

Q. Explain the available thread states in a high-level.
Ans. Runnable: A thread becomes ready to run, but does not necessarily start running immediately.
     Running: The processor is actively executing the thread code.
     Waiting: A thread is in a blocked state waiting for some external processing to finish.
     Sleeping: The thread is forced to sleep.
     Blocked on I/O: Waiting for an I/O operation to complete.
     Blocked on Synchronization: Waiting to acquire a lock.
     Dead: The thread has finished its execution.

Q.  What is the difference between a synchronized method and a synchronized block ?
Ans.In Java programming, each object has a lock. A thread can acquire the lock for an object by using the synchronized keyword. 
    The synchronized keyword can be applied in a method level (coarse grained lock) or block level of code (fine grained lock) 

Q.   How do you ensure that N threads can access N resources without deadlock ?
Ans. A very simple way to avoid deadlock while using N threads is to impose an ordering on the locks and force each thread
     to follow that ordering. Thus, if all threads lock and unlock the mutexes in the same order, no deadlocks can arise.

Q.  What are the basic interfaces of Java Collections Framework ?
Ans.Collection, which represents a group of objects known as its elements.
    Set, which is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
    List, which is an ordered collection and can contain duplicate elements.
    Map, which is an object that maps keys to values and cannot contain duplicate keys.

Q. What is an Iterator ?
Ans. The Iterator interface provides a number of methods that are able to iterate over any Collection. Each Java 
     Collection contains the Iterator method that returns an Iterator instance. Iterators are capable of removing 
     elements from the underlying collection during the iteration.

Q. What differences exist between Iterator and ListIterator ?
Ans. An Iterator can be used to traverse the Set and List collections, while the ListIterator can be used to iterate only over List .
     The Iterator can traverse a collection only in forward direction, while the ListIterator can traverse a List in both directions.
     The ListIterator implements the Iterator interface and contains extra functionality, such as adding an element, replacing an 
     element, getting the index position for previous and next elements, etc.

Q. How HashMap works in Java ?
Ans. A HashMap in Java stores key-value pairs. The HashMap requires a hash function and uses hashCode and equals methods, 
     in order to put and retrieve elements to and from the collection respectively. When the put method is invoked, the 
     HashMap calculates the hash value of the key and stores the pair in the appropriate index inside the collection. 
     If the key exists, its value is updated with the new value. Some important characteristics of a HashMap are its capacity, 
     its load factor and the threshold resizing.

Q. What is the importance of hashCode() and equals() methods ?
Ans. A HashMap in Java uses the hashCode and equals methods to determine the index of the key-value pair. These methods are 
     also used when we request the value of a specific key. If these methods are not implemented correctly, two different 
     keys might produce the same hash value and thus, will be considered as equal by the collection. Furthermore, these methods 
     are also used to detect duplicates. Thus, the implementation of both methods is crucial to the accuracy and correctness of 
     the HashMap.

Q. What differences exist between HashMap and Hashtable ?
Ans. A HashMap allows the existence of null keys and values, while a Hashtable doesn’t allow neither null keys, nor null values.
     A Hashtable is synchronized, while a HashMap is not. Thus, HashMap is preferred in single-threaded environments, 
     while a Hashtable is suitable for multi-threaded environments.
     A HashMap provides its set of keys and a Java application can iterate over them. Thus, a HashMap is fail-fast. 
     On the other hand, a Hashtable provides an Enumeration of its keys.
     The Hashtable class is considered to be a legacy class.

Q.  What is Comparable and Comparator interface ?
Ans. Java provides the Comparable interface, which contains only one method, called compareTo). This method compares two objects,
     in order to impose an order between them. Specifically, it returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate 
     that the input object is less than, equal or greater than the existing object. Java provides the Comparator interface, which 
     contains two methods, called compare) and equals). The first method compares its two input arguments and imposes an order 
     between them. It returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer to indicate that the first argument is less than, 
     equal to, or greater than the second. The second method requires an object as a parameter and aims to decide whether the 
     input object is equal to the comparator. The method returns true, only if the specified object is also a comparator and it 
     imposes the same ordering as the comparator.

Q.  What is Java Priority Queue ?
Ans. The PriorityQueue is an unbounded queue, based on a priority heap and its elements are ordered in their natural order. At 
     the time of its creation, we can provide a Comparator that is responsible for ordering the elements of the PriorityQueue. 
     A PriorityQueue doesn’t allow null values, those objects that doesn’t provide natural ordering, or those objects that 
     don’t have any comparator associated with them. Finally, the Java PriorityQueue is not thread-safe and it requires 
     O(log(n)) time for its enqueing and dequeing operations.

Q. What’s the difference between Enumeration and Iterator interfaces ?
Ans. Enumeration is twice as fast as compared to an Iterator and uses very less memory. However, the Iterator is much safer 
     compared to Enumeration, because other threads are not able to modify the collection object that is currently traversed by 
     the iterator. Also, Iterators allow the caller to remove elements from the underlying collection, something which is not 
     possible with Enumeration.

Q.  What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet ?
Ans. The HashSet is Implemented using a hash table and thus, its elements are not ordered. The add, remove, and contains methods 
    of a HashSet have constant time complexity O(1). On the other hand, a TreeSet is implemented using a tree structure. The 
    elements in a TreeSet are sorted, and thus, the add, remove, and contains methods have time complexity of O(logn).

Q. When is the finalize() called ? What is the purpose of finalization ?
Ans. The finalize method is called by the garbage collector, just before releasing the object’s memory. It is normally advised 
     to release resources held by the object inside the finalize method.

Q. What is structure of Java Heap ? What is Perm Gen space in Heap ?
Ans. The JVM has a heap that is the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated. It 
     is created at the JVM start-up. Heap memory for objects is reclaimed by an automatic memory management system which is 
     known as a garbage collector. Heap memory consists of live and dead objects. Live objects are accessible by the application
     and will not be a subject of garbage collection. Dead objects are those which will never be accessible by the application, 
     but have not been collected by the garbage collector yet. Such objects occupy the heap memory space until they are eventually 
     collected by the garbage collector.

Q. What are the two types of Exceptions in Java ? Which are the differences between them ?
Ans. Java has two types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions. Unchecked exceptions do not need to be declared 
     in a method or a constructor’s throws clause, if they can be thrown by the execution of the method or the constructor, 
     and propagate outside the method or constructor boundary. On the other hand, checked exceptions must be declared in a method 
     or a constructor’s throws clause. See here for tips on Java exception handling.

Q. What is the difference between Exception and Error in java ?
Ans.Exception and Error classes are both subclasses of the Throwable class. The Exception class is used for exceptional conditions 
    that a user’s program should catch. The Error class defines exceptions that are not excepted to be caught by the user program.

Q.  What is the difference between throw and throws ?
Ans. The throw keyword is used to explicitly raise a exception within the program. On the contrary, the throws clause is used to 
     indicate those exceptions that are not handled by a method. Each method must explicitly specify which exceptions does not
     handle, so the callers of that method can guard against possible exceptions. Finally, multiple exceptions are separated 
     by a comma.

Q. What is the importance of finally block in exception handling ?
Ans. A finally block will always be executed, whether or not an exception is actually thrown. Even in the case where the 
     catch statement is missing and an exception is thrown, the finally block will still be executed. Last thing to mention 
     is that the finally block is used to release resources like I/O buffers, database connections, etc.

Q. How does finally block differ from finalize() method ?
Ans. A finally block will be executed whether or not an exception is thrown and is used to release those resources held by 
     the application. Finalize is a protected method of the Object class, which is called by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
     just before an object is garbage collected.
    
Q. What is an inline function?
Ans.An inline function is the techqnique used by the compilers to insert complete body of the function wherever that function
    is used in the program source code.

Q. What is a virtual function ?
Ans.A virtual function is a member function of a class, and its functionality can be overridden in its derived class. This 
    function can be implemented using a keyword called virtual, and it can be given during function decalaration.

Q. What is a friend function ?
Ans.A friend function the a friend of  a class that is allowed access to public, privarte protected data in the same class.
    If the function is defined outside the class, the class cannot access such information.

Q. What is a super keyword ?
Ans. Super keyword is used to invoke the overridden method which overrides one of its superclass methods. This keyword allow
    access to the overridden methods and also access to the hidden members of the super class.

Q. What is the difference between new and override?
Ans. The new keyword instructs the compiler to use the new implementation instead of the base class function.

Q. Difference between a structure and a class ?
Ans. Structure default access type is public, but class access type is private. A structure is used for grouping data whereas
    class can be used for grouping data and methods. Structures are exclusively used for data, and it doesn't require strict
    validation, but classes are used to encapsulates and ingerit data which requires strict validation.
