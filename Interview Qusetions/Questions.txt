Q. HTTP and SSL protocols.
Ans:The hypertext transfer protocol is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative and hypermedia information systems.
    HTTP is the protocol to transfer or exchange hypertext. The hypertext is the structured text that uses hyperlinks. HTTP 
    functions as a request-response protocol in the client-server computing model. the client submits an HTTP request to the server,
    to which the server provides resources such as HTML. HTTP is an application layes protocol designed with a framework of the
    Internet protocol suite. 

    SSL-Secure Sockets Layers are cryptographic perotocols that provide communication security over a computer network. 
        applications - Web browsing, email, instant messaging. This link ensures that all data passed between the web server and 
        browsers remain private and integral. After activating your web server we get two cryptographic keys - a private key and
        a public key. The Public Key does not need to be secret and is placed into a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) - a data
        file also containing your details. You should then submit the CSR. During the SSL Certificate application process, the 
        Certification Authority will validate your details and issue an SSL Certificate containing your details and allowing you 
        to use SSL. Your web server will match your issued SSL Certificate to your Private Key. Your web server will then be able 
        to establish an encrypted link between the website and your customer's web browser.

Q. Explain what happens in details and behind the scene when you type in your browser google.com.
Ans: 

Q. Command line to check routing table in linux
Ans.The routing table is used to show you where various different network subnets will be routed to
    Using ip command - `ip route` or `ip r`.

Q. linux command to check disc space.
Ans:df - shows the amount of disc space used and available on linux file systems.
    du -Display the amount of disk space used by the specified files and for each subdirectory.

Q. linux command to list running processes.
Ans: ps -A or top

Q. Example of linux file system.
Ans:

Q. difference between /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages.
Ans. Syslog is a standard logging facility. It collects messages of various programs and services including the kernel, stores them 
     mdepending on the setup, in a buncl of log files. Logs everything 

    /var/log/messages instead aims at storing valuable, non-debug and non-critical messages. This log should be considered 
    the "general system activity" log.

Q. What is hhtp header ?
Ans. Http header allows the client and the server to pass additional information with the request or the response. They define 
    operating paramters of an HTTP   transaction. The header fields are transmitted after the request or response line. A header
    consists of its case -sensitive name followed by a colon: then by its value. The standard imposes no limits to the size of 
    each header field name or value, or to the number field. However, most servers put size size restrictions for security reasons.

    Standard request field = Authorization, content-type, X-Csrf-Token, cookie
    Standard response field =  Access-Control-Allow-Origin, locartion, content-type

Q. What is ping ?
Ans:ping is a basic internet program that allows a user to verify that a particular IP address exists and can except request.
    ping works by sending an internet control message protocol (ICMP) exho request to a specified interface or network and 
    waiting for a reply. It is used measure latency, or the time it takes to send and receive a packet of data between two devices
    on a network. 

Q. what is the difference between ping and traceroute ?
Ans: Traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool for displaying the route and measuring transit delays of packets across a
     network. It also shows the number of hops required to reaxcxh to that point.

     The main difference between Ping and Traceroute is that Ping is a quick and easy utility to tell if the specified server 
     is reachable and how long will it take to send and receive data from the server whereas Traceroute finds the exact route 
     taken to reach the server and time taken by each step (hop).

Q. Define tcp connection ?
Ans: TCP is a standard that defines how to establish and maintain a network conversation via which application programs can 
    exchange data. TCP wotks with the IP, which defines how computes sends packets of data to each other,TCP is a
    connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at 
    each end have finished exchanging messages.

Q. 4 ways close?
Ans. 

Q. 6 flags in tcp header ?
Ans: SYN: Synchronization flag is used to setup a 3-way handshake between two hosts.
     ACK: Acknowledgement.
     FIN: Finished, there is no more data from the sender.
     URG: notify received to process urgent packets before regular packets.
     PSH: tells the receiver to process these packets as they are received instead of buffering,
     RST: reset.
     CWR: The CWR flag, which stands for Congestion Window Reduced, is used by the sending host 
          to indicate it received a packet with the ECE flag set.

Q. Define submask ?
Ans: A subnet mask is a 32 bit number that masks an IP address and divides the IP address into network address and host address.

Q. Location of messages in linux ?

Q. Define NTP ?
Ans - Network time protocol is used to syncrhonize computer clock times in a network.

Q. Define INode ?
Ans: An inode is a data-structure on a file system on linux that stores al the information about a file excepts its name and 
    its actual data.

Q. Which one is better? HashTable or Binary balanced trees? List scenarios when you will prefer HashTable.
Ans: Hasn table supports following operations 1. Search, insert, delete - O(1), in BST its O(Logn)..
    Advantages of BST
    Can get all keys in sorted order just by doing inorder traversal.
    Doing order statistics, finding closest lower and greater elements doing range queries are easy to do with BSTs.
    time is always O(Logn), can change in Hash table, expecially in resizing.

Q. Difference between Router, Hub and a switch ?
Ans: Router: It forwards data packets along networks. Routers are located at the gateways. Connected to atleast two networks
    Switch: swithc is a device that filters and forwards packets between LAN segments. operated in data link later or network layer.
    Hub: A hub is a common connection point for devices in a network. Hubs connect segments of a LAN. It contains multiple ports so 
    when a packet arrives at one port, it is copied to the other ports so that all segments of the LAN can see all packets.

Q. Explain OSI model ?
Q. Explain TCP 3-way handshake ?
Ans: 
    A three-way handshake is a method used in a TCP/IP network to create a connection between a local host/client and server. 
    It is a three-step method that requires both the client and server to exchange SYN and ACK (acknowledgment) packets 
    before actual data communication begins.
    
Q. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses ?
Ans:  IPv4 stands for Internet Protocol version 4. It is the underlying technology that makes it possible for us to connect 
    our devices to the web. Whenever a device access the Internet (whether it's a PC, Mac, smartphone or other device), 
    it is assigned a unique, numerical IP address such as 99.48.227.227. To send data from one computer to another through 
    the web, a data packet must be transferred across the network containing the IP addresses of both devices.

Q linux Command - ls, grep, find ?
Ans:searches for matching a regular expression against text in a file, multiple files or a stream of input. It searches 
    for the pattern of text that you specify on the command line and prints output for you.

Q. Size of a TCP window?
