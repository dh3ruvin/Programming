Big question -

 *
 * A significant part of Credit Karma's platform is identifying well-matched
 * financial offers for our users based on many factors including a user's
 * current credit score. For this test you'll be asked to develop a
 * rudimentary system that does exactly that.
 *
 * The goal of the system is to serve offers to users. You'll develop this
 * in a stepwise manner. Whenever you're asked to serve an offer to the user
 * the implementation should result in the offers being printed to the console.
 *
 * Step 1: Return all of the offers from each service to the user.
 *
 * Step 2: Only return offers from each service where the user's credit score is between (inclusive) the offers minimum and maximum score.
 *
 * Step 3: Serve all relevant offers from step 2 and only the auto loan offers to the user if the following conditions are true:
 * (a) The user's credit score is within the offer's range
 * (b) The user's current outstanding loan is less than or equal to the auto loan offer's high limit.
